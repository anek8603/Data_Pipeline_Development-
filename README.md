# Data_Pipeline_Development-
This project demonstrates how to build a machine learning data pipeline using `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, and `joblib`. The pipeline handles both **numerical** and **categorical** data using appropriate preprocessing techniques and trains a decision tree model.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Python
- pandas, numpy
- scikit-learn
- joblib

## 📁 Project Files
- `data_pipeline.py` – Contains the full data pipeline code with model saving and loading.
- `requirements.txt` – List of dependencies.
- `pipe.joblib` – Saved model pipeline.

## 🚀 How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python data_pipeline.py
```

## ✅ Output
- Model training and testing accuracy for both simple and full pipelines.
- Saved model as `pipe.joblib`.
